## Foreword (or, Why bother?)

Buckle up for a long ride!

This tester is designed to try out a very broad range of combinations for the
5, 100, and 500 array sizes that your `push_swap` program is supposed to sort.

As you probably know by now, during your `push_swap` evaluation, your evaluator
will be asked to take the average case of your program and then rank your
project according to this average case for each array size.

However, evaluations where the average case is measured with some accuracy have
been very hard to find. This is because the number of permutations that can be
generated from an N sized array is N!, which is an astronomical number. And I
mean, it is a number so big that it couldn't fit in a million `size_t` variables,
even if we divided it by a billion.

So, for any case beyond the array 5 elements, it is impossible for the
evaluator to calculate the exact average case of your `push_swap` algorithm. But
this is not an excuse to simply test your program with 5 or 10 random arrays of
size 100 and 500 and draw conclusions out of it!

This is so much of a big deal that it could make or break your project! Imagine
how insufficient it is to measure 10 cases out of 100! The average of those ten
could be really far from the truth. It would be 10 random cases out of:

93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000

For an array of size 500 the number is even more obscene:

1220136825991110068701238785423046926253574342803192842192413588385845373153881997605496447502203281863013616477148203584163378722078177200480785205159329285477907571939330603772960859086270429174547882424912726344305670173270769461062802310452644218878789465754777149863494367781037644274033827365397471386477878495438489595537537990423241061271326984327745715546309977202781014561081188373709531016356324432987029563896628911658974769572087926928871281780070265174507768410719624390394322536422605234945850129918571501248706961568141625359056693423813008856249246891564126775654481886506593847951775360894005745238940335798476363944905313062323749066445048824665075946735862074637925184200459369692981022263971952597190945217823331756934581508552332820762820023402626907898342451712006207714640979456116127629145951237229913340169552363850942885592018727433795173014586357570828355780158735432768888680120399882384702151467605445407663535984174430480128938313896881639487469658817504506926365338175055478128640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

This is why the `push_swap-averager` was born

To test thousands of permutations in a semi-random pattern that would be as
representative as possible, I have divided the total number of permutations
of an N-sized array into N groups. Then, I pick up 12 random permutations
from each of these N groups to create the sample set of permutations that will
be tested as input for your `push_swap`. These permutations were initially
generated by a very simple implementation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

This means that for the 100 size case, the `push_swap-averager` will be
executing your push_swap 1,200 times. It is still a small number compared to
the total. But because of the way the combinations are selected, the result is
a very consistent measurement of your average case and it can be finished
within 2 seconds on the 4 cores / 2 threads per core iMacs we have at the 42
school.

As it was, if I ran the `push_swap-averager` 15 times in a row, I would see a
slightly different result each time so I had to calculate the average
oscillations between the different averages and choose to see if the average is
being calculated with enough accuracy. For example, out of 15 tests, my
`push_swap` program ranked averages between 574 and 605. This is a "margin of error"
of 31 operations, so I had to increase the number of tests (up to 15,000) to get to an
acceptable margin of 10. It was taking 30 seconds now instead of 2, so I
thought it was ok.

However, when I applied the same Fisher-Yates algorithm to randomize the 500
elements array, I realized the result (the measurement of the average) was not
consistent enough unless the test took 5 to 10 minutes, and that is definitely
too much time.

So I had to do some research on the basics of Pseudorandomness in computer science
and decided to implement the Mersenne-Twister algorithm to improve both the
consistency of the average-case calculations and the execution speed of the
program. 

The Mersenne Twister algorithm is a well-known and widely used algorithm for
generating high-quality pseudo-random numbers. It has been extensively tested
and shown to be very efficient and effective at generating well-distributed
permutations. In fact, it is commonly used in scientific simulations and other
applications that require high-quality random number generation. That is why I
chose it. You can find its implementation in the source file called
`mersenne_twister_algorithm.c`.

Now, with more well-distributed permutations the program takes 2 seconds to
calculate the avereage of the size 100 with the same margin of error of 10
operations. Remember it was taking 30 seconds to do the same with the old
algorithm. And for the size 500 it narrows down to a margin of error of 46
operations in a one and a half minute test instead of the 22 minutes it
would take with the Fisher-Yates algorihm to achieve the same accuracy.

I know I could have done it all with a short `Bash` script, and it would make
for a shorter code and a simpler program. In fact, I had done it before... But
it was taking three and one half hours to test 10,000 combinations of size
500. This is why this tester was written in `C`: a compiled language with
low-level scope which is usually faster and supports a multithreaded approach.

So this is why I bothered to make this test: to have a quick and accurate way
of assessing the average-cases of push_swap programs, but mostly to learn a lot
of stuff in the process of (hopefully) achieving that.

## Trivia
- The longest English word with all its letters in alphabetical order is
"aegilops," which is a type of plant.
- Scientists have discovered a set of snow crystals that may be the first
matching pair ever found, challenging the common belief that no two snowflakes
are alike. The crystals were collected on a glass plate during a research
flight over Wisconsin in 1986 and were found to have almost identical growth
histories. The discovery raises the possibility that more identical pairs of
snow crystals could be found in the future.
- The traditional method of shuffling playing cards, known as the riffle
shuffle, is not truly random. A study published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences found that if someone knows the initial order of
the cards, they can predict the outcome of a riffle shuffle with high
accuracy.
